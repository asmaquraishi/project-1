# About the game:
a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares; noughts and crosses.

# Features Included:
- User can play game and start as X then O then X then O, etc
- User can not choose a space that is already taken
- User can win game and see a message for the result
- Count a score for User win's even when the user start a new game
- User can not keep playing after the game is over
- User can restart the game to play again

# Difficulties:
- when added each new feature for the game i needed to change some previous code , it's depended in each other.
- difficulty with CSS borders

# Favourite working part:
- Practicing on jQuery functions that i've learned
- CSS background colors and some styles
- HTML

# Future development planning:
 add features:
     - User can play with the computer 
     - Allow players to customize their tokens (X, O, name, etc..)
     - Get inventive style

# Approach:
- Using If statement in each user clicks, target the event then save it in an array
- Using if statement for indexes comparstion
- When indexes matches display the winner 
- Count the score after each wins 
- Using a loop through indexes ID's to clear event text for new game!

# Unsolved problems:
- After win if you click on random spaces, the previous winnerâ€™s win count keeps going up!
